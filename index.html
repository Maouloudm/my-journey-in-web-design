    <h1>My journey in Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web design was my first CTE class and I think it was very enjoyable for me because it was something new that I did not know about and a new topic. I never thought about doing something with websites or even creating them and learning something intresting that is new was great for me. With the addition of a new skill could even help me with jobs with computers in the future if I ever need to create a website for a company. </p>

    <p> So what I thought about this class was that it was fun and I think is a great introduction to CTE in the school with a great teacher who made the topic nice to learn and fun to study about. and I think that this class suprised me because before I started coming to this school U thought that game design was the only thing I wanted to do and the others were useless but I realized that everything is pretty good and web design helped me see that.  </p>
